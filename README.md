# openMMRL - MetaMotion RL head tracker OSC bridge

Use an Mbientlab **MetaMotion RL** (MMRL) as a head tracker for spatial audio. It is
built on bleak, so it is meant to be cross-platform, but so far it is **developed and
tested on macOS (Apple Silicon) only** - Windows and Linux are untested.

> **There's a GUI app: Busola** ([GitLab](https://git.pg.edu.pl/p829296/busola-app) / [GitHub](https://github.com/mormegil6/busola-app)). A menu-bar app that drives this tracker - plus Waves Nx, Supperware and MrHeadTracker - with device memory, live profile-switching and CSV logging. This repo is the bridge it's built on.

The script connects to the MMRL over Bluetooth LE, runs the sensor's on-board
Bosch BSX NDOF (9-axis) fusion (or, with `--vqf`, host-side VQF - Versatile
Quaternion-based Filter - fusion of the raw IMU), and sends the head-tracking
orientation as OSC to a chosen spatial-audio
renderer. Each renderer wants a particular OSC address, argument order, per-axis
sign convention and UDP port, so openMMRL uses selectable **profiles**
(`--profile`) rather than a few fixed addresses.

</details>

Each profile applies the correct address, per-axis sign/swap and port. Axis and
sign conventions are verified against
[Supperware Bridgehead](https://supperware.co.uk/headtracker-bridgehead)'s
profile list. You can add your own in a `profiles.txt` in this script's per-user
config dir - `~/Library/Application Support/openmmrl/` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\openmmrl`
(Windows) or `~/.config/openmmrl/` (Linux). Each profile is four lines - name, address,
args, port - in Supperware's `Profiles.txt` format; `openmmrl.py` loads them on top of
the built-in profiles.

**Protocol:** the full reverse-engineered MetaWear GATT protocol and hardware
notes are in [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Why this exists

The official `metawear` Python SDK does not run on macOS: it has a hard-coded
Darwin check and its `warble` BLE backend has no CoreBluetooth support. On
Linux and Windows the SDK works, but on macOS there is no maintained way to use
the device. This project talks to the MetaWear GATT interface directly with
[`bleak`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak) (native CoreBluetooth), so it needs no
Mbientlab software at all.

The protocol was worked out empirically and cross-checked against the
[MetaWear-SDK-Cpp](https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-Cpp) source; the
full write-up is in [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md) so it can be
reimplemented in any language.

## What was discovered (short version)

- Streaming the on-board fusion quaternion is not a single command: the raw
  accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer must be configured and started
  first (the engine consumes them), then the fusion output is enabled and the
  quaternion register subscribed. Skipping the raw-sensor setup, or the
  subscribe, leaves the engine reporting enabled while emitting no data.
- The on-board BSX fusion runs at a fixed ~100 Hz. Its config sets only the mode
  (NDOF) and the accel/gyro ranges - there is no output-rate field - so the
  quaternion rate is not selectable over BLE. A lower rate could save battery, but
  it would have to be set on-device and the firmware does not expose that.
- The raw data registers are not uniform: accelerometer data is on register
  `0x04`, but gyroscope and magnetometer data are on `0x05` (used by `--vqf`).
- IEM SceneRotator accepts the individual `/SceneRotator/qw,qx,qy,qz` parameters
  (what the default profile sends) as well as `/SceneRotator/quaternions`
  (4 floats); the legacy `/SceneRotator/quat` is silently ignored.
- The unit is a Bosch **BMI160 + BMM150**. macOS addresses it by a per-Mac
  CoreBluetooth UUID, not a MAC.
- The device advertises indefinitely (no quick auto-sleep) and accepts one
  connection at a time, so an empty scan usually means another app holds it.

Full details, byte sequences and scales are in
[docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Addressing

On macOS, CoreBluetooth addresses peripherals by a stable **per-Mac UUID**, not
by their MAC address, so pass that UUID to `--device`. The value is printed
during the scan and differs on other machines.

## Fusion modes

By default the device's on-board Bosch BSX engine computes the orientation
(NDOF, 9-axis) and the script streams that quaternion.

With `--vqf`, the script instead streams the raw accelerometer, gyroscope and
magnetometer and runs [VQF](https://github.com/dlaidig/vqf) fusion on the host.
VQF includes magnetometer-disturbance detection and rejection, which helps keep
the heading from being pulled off course by magnetic interference (near speakers,
motors, laptops, steel) the way a plain 9-axis fusion would be. It falls back to
6-axis (gyro + accelerometer) until magnetometer samples arrive.

```bash
pip install vqf          # required for --vqf (pulls in numpy)
python openmmrl.py --vqf
```

The terminal shows a `[VQF]` prefix in this mode. The board temperature is read
and shown in both fusion modes; it is only written to the CSV in `--vqf` mode
(the log needs VQF's bias and disturbance columns). OSC output, tare, LED and
reconnect behave the same as the default mode.

## Logging (--vqf)

`--log FILE` (only with `--vqf`) writes a CSV at about 1 Hz for thermal-drift
analysis, with columns:

    timestamp, nrf_soc_temp_c, gyro_bias_x, gyro_bias_y, gyro_bias_z, quat_w,
    quat_x, quat_y, quat_z, yaw_deg, pitch_deg, roll_deg, mag_disturbance_flag

`nrf_soc_temp_c` is the nRF52 SoC on-die temperature (MetaWear temperature
module, NRF_SOC source = channel 0, scaled 1/8 C per LSB). The MMRL does not
expose the BMI160 die temperature and has no working BMP280/BME280, so the nRF52
SoC reading is used as a board-temperature proxy: it correlates with, but is not
identical to, the gyroscope die temperature. `gyro_bias_*` is VQF's gyroscope
bias estimate in rad/s, and `mag_disturbance_flag` is VQF's
magnetometer-disturbance state (1 = disturbance rejected). Logging temperature
alongside the gyro bias and heading supports characterising how much heading
drift is thermal versus random.

```bash
python openmmrl.py --vqf --log drift.csv
```

## Sleep and wake

By default the MMRL advertises continuously, so it never really powers off. This
bridge can deep-sleep it (lowest-power state, via the debug power-save + reset):

- **Hold the button** (~1.5 s) to sleep it immediately; a quick tap still tares.
- **Idle timeout:** it sleeps after `--sleep-timeout` seconds with no orientation
  change (default 300; `0` disables).
- **On exit:** Ctrl-C / kill also sleeps it, so it does not keep advertising once
  you are done (`--no-sleep-on-exit` leaves it awake instead).

**Wake** with a single button press: the device re-advertises, the bridge
auto-reconnects, and the LED blue-blinks to confirm. Wake is firmware-level, so
it is a single press, not a double-click. A sleeping MMRL does not advertise, so
it will not appear in a scan until the button is pressed.

## Features

- Scan and pick a MetaWear/MetaMotion device, or connect directly by UUID.
- Battery level read on connect.
- Quaternion streaming at about 100 Hz, from on-board BSX fusion or, with
  `--vqf`, from host-side VQF fusion of the raw IMU.
- Selectable per-renderer OSC profiles (`--profile` / `--list-profiles`); several
  at once with port-collision detection.
- Yaw/pitch/roll shown in the terminal at about 5 Hz.
- Tare (zero the heading) with **Enter** or a quick tap of the device button.
- Locate the device with **`i`** then Enter: the LED flashes magenta (red+blue)
  a few times, then returns to the battery colour.
- Deep-sleep on a button hold, an idle timeout, or clean exit; a single press
  wakes it (see Sleep and wake above).
- Device LED reflects battery level:
  - green: above 75%
  - orange (red + green): 15-75%
  - pulsing red: below 15%
  - blue: connected but battery could not be read
  - the LED is cleared on a clean stop, so a lit LED means the script is running.
- Auto-reconnect every 3 s if the link drops.
- Clean shutdown on Ctrl-C or kill (SIGTERM): stops the sensors and clears the
  LED before disconnecting.

## Usage (CLI, from source)

Requires Python 3.9 or newer.

```bash
python3 -m venv openmmrl-venv
source openmmrl-venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python openmmrl.py                 # scan, then pick a device by number
```

Skip the scan with a known UUID (printed during the scan):

```bash
python openmmrl.py --device XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
python openmmrl.py --profile SPARTA        # emit the SPARTA profile (port 9000)
python openmmrl.py --profile "APL Virtuoso" --port 8001   # override the port
python openmmrl.py --list-profiles         # show every profile and exit
python openmmrl.py --all           # list all BLE devices if no MetaWear is found
python openmmrl.py --vqf           # host-side VQF fusion (needs the vqf package)
python openmmrl.py --vqf --log drift.csv   # also log temp/bias/heading at ~1 Hz
python openmmrl.py --sleep-timeout 600     # auto-sleep after 10 min idle (0 = never)
python openmmrl.py --no-sleep-on-exit      # keep advertising after Ctrl-C
```

Choosing a renderer:

- `--profile NAME` picks the OSC profile (default `IEM SceneRotator (quaternion)`).
  Names match case-insensitively and by unique substring, so `--profile sparta`
  or `--profile virtuoso` work; `--list-profiles` prints them all.
- The profile sets the address, mapping **and port**; `--port` is an optional
  override of that port.
- `--profile` can be repeated to drive several renderers at once. If two selected
  profiles share a port they would collide on the same UDP socket, so openMMRL
  refuses and lists the clash; give them different ports or pass
  `--force-collision` to send anyway.

Point the renderer's OSC receive at `127.0.0.1` on the profile's port (shown by
`--list-profiles`). Tap the button or press **Enter** while looking forward to
zero the heading; type **`i`** then Enter to flash the LED magenta and locate the
device; hold the button to put the device to sleep.

### Testing without a plugin

`osc_monitor.py` prints whatever arrives on a port:

```bash
python osc_monitor.py --port 8000   # in a second terminal
```

## Bluetooth permission (macOS)

The first BLE scan triggers a permission prompt for the app running it (Terminal,
iTerm, VS Code, or a built binary). Allow it. If scanning finds nothing, check
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth.

## Standalone binary

Build a single signed executable for Apple Silicon with PyInstaller:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --name openmmrl \
  --hidden-import bleak.backends.corebluetooth \
  --hidden-import bleak.backends.corebluetooth.scanner \
  --hidden-import bleak.backends.corebluetooth.client \
  openmmrl.py
codesign --deep --force --sign - dist/openmmrl   # ad-hoc sign

./dist/openmmrl
```

For `--vqf` in the binary, add `--hidden-import vqf --hidden-import vqf.vqf
--collect-submodules numpy` to the build. The result runs on any Apple Silicon
Mac without Python installed. The `build/` and `dist/` artifacts are git-ignored;
build them locally or attach the binary to a release.

## Troubleshooting

- **Scan finds nothing:** the MMRL only advertises when it is not connected to
  another app (quit MetaBase or the phone app, including other script instances)
  and is charged. Use `--all` to list every BLE device.
- **Connected but no angles:** the full NDOF start sequence (raw acc/gyro/mag
  config and start, then fusion enable and subscribe) is in `FUSION_START_SEQ`
  and documented in [docs/PROTOCOL.md](docs/PROTOCOL.md).
- **Plugin does not move:** check the OSC port and that the renderer listens on
  the profile's address (see `--list-profiles`); the default profile uses port 9000.
- **Wrong rotation axis or direction:** pick the profile that matches your
  renderer - each applies that renderer's axis/sign convention (verified against
  [Supperware Bridgehead](https://supperware.co.uk/headtracker-bridgehead)). The
  generic `Quaternion`/`YPR` profiles send unremapped values if you need a raw feed.
- **Connects, then drops repeatedly:** almost always 2.4 GHz radio interference,
  not the bridge. The MetaMotion RL is a coin-sized, ultra-low-power tag with a
  tiny chip antenna, so its BLE link is easily disturbed. The biggest and least
  obvious culprit is **USB 3.x / Thunderbolt docks, hubs and bus-powered SSDs**,
  which radiate broadband noise around 2.4 GHz. It is strongest at contact but,
  against the RL's weak transmitter, still bites from 10-20 cm - it does not take
  direct contact. Reproduced here: a closed-lid laptop on a 15 cm aluminium stand
  dropped the RL repeatedly while a Thunderbolt dock (Plugable TBT4-UDZ, ~3.6 cm
  tall) and an audio interface (RME Digiface Dante, ~2.6 cm tall) sat ~10 cm below
  it - not touching - and held once moved aside. Keep the Mac away from docks, hubs and
  drives, keep the tracker within ~1 m line of sight, and keep other
  2.4 GHz sources (Wi-Fi, other Bluetooth, GPU render boxes whose power transients
  spike the noise floor) clear. The bridge reconnects every 3 s, so it recovers on
  its own once the link is clean. Reference: Intel, *USB 3.0 Radio Frequency
  Interference Impact on 2.4 GHz Wireless Devices*, white paper
  [327216-001](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/327216.pdf), April 2012.

## Roadmap

- Test on Linux (BlueZ) and Windows (WinRT). The bridge uses bleak, which is
  cross-platform, but only macOS is verified so far; on those platforms the
  device is addressed by its MAC rather than a per-Mac CoreBluetooth UUID.
